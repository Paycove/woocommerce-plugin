# Paycove Payment Gateway

WIP for Paycove.

## Install

You know the drill:

```bash
# Install
npm install
composer install

# Build JS assets for plugin.
npm start
```

## Formatting and linting

See `composer.json` and `package.json` for available formatting and linting scripts.

## Plugin distribution

Run the following:
```
npm run build
npm run plugin-zip
```

This will build a `.zip` of the build version of the plugin for distribution.
